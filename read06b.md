# Introducing how computers work.

Computers are everywhere.

Computer work with four steps

1. Take in data
1. store data
1. process data
1. output data

# How computers work : What makes a computer a computer ?

Type of input

- keyboard
- camera
- mouse
- touch screen
- microphone

Types of Output

- text
- photos
- videos
- games
- vr
- robot

# How computers work: Binary & Data

One wire can have one of either value:

- 1 or 0
- true or false
- yes or no
- on or off
  The above information is call a **Bit**,the more wires the more bits.

## The binary number system

made up of only zeros and ones counting twos

Example: number nine will be 1001 (left to right values are 8 , 0 , 0, 1)

Eight wires can store range from 0 to 255
32 wires can store range from 0 to over 4 billion

Text can be converted to numbers , by each letter having a value which is then converted using binary code.

Images, videos and graphics are made up of pixels that are made up of colors. The colors are made up of numbers (RGB code)

Sounds are vibrations in the air that can be interpreted in **sound waveform** which each point can be represented by numbers.

# How computers work: Circuits and Logic

Circuits are like the converter from input device to the output device.

Circuits can be combined together to make more complex circuits either adding , subtracting or multiplying .

Computer are made of many complex circuits put together

Electricity moves at just about the speed of light.

Therefore the smaller the physical circuit is, the less distance the electricity has to travel, hence being faster than larger circuits.

# How computers work: CPU, memory, input and output.

- Input - converts physical input information to binary information
- Memory - stores information
- CPU - Central processing unit calculates information
- Output - converts information to physical output

# How computers work: Hardware and software

- Hardware
- Circuits
- chips
- wires
- speakers
- plugs

- Software
- apps
- games
- websites
- maps
- creative
- analysis

CPU is master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.

Operating system is the master program that manages how the software uses the hardware of a computer.

The operating system is like this, imagine a telephone patch system where a person called an operator patches in the line signal to the person you are trying to call. Thats initially what the `OS` is doing but a million times faster.

The OS is receiving , transferring signals from multiple programs at the same time.
