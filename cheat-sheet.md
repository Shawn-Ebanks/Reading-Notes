# Choosing a text editor :

A **text editor** is software that allows you to write and manage text used for web development.

There are many editors to choose from, not all are equally designed but most are pretty similar.

Some great features are :

- Code completion - Similar to autocorrect suggestions for code
- Emmet (Shorthand language)- shortcut code that enables efficiency typing code and avoiding typos
- Syntax highlighting - Coding in different colors for easier readability.

**Text Edit** and **Notepad** are examples of text editors that come already installed on computers. They don’t have any features and are completely bare

Third party Options for editors are : Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.They can all be downloaded for free.

An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is basically a package software that is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one. To put that in prospective, its like MS Outlook that is combined , email , calendar and to-do list . It can do it all.

# The Command Line:

## GUI (graphical user interface)

The _command line_ is a text based interface to the system.

The terminal/command line has built in shortcut , Up arrow will go through stored history commands entered.

# Basic Navigation

- 'pwd' (Print Working Directory)
- 'ls' (list) contents within the directory
- '~' (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory
  \* '.'(dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
- '..' (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory.
- 'Cd' (change directory)

# More about files!

First off, everything is a file in someway or another.

File extensions indicate file type. Eg. File.png, or file.jpg indicate thees files are images.

### Side note:

Commands are case sensitive

Avoid naming files with spaces where possible.

If not possible command will think its path is two separate arguments.

To work around a file name with a space in it , use quotes or escape characters(backwards slash\).

Hidden file name begins with a dot in front of it. Example .file.txt

### Side note:

'ls -a' (list contents of a directory inclusive of hidden files)
