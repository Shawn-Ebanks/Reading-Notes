## The `ABC` of programming

- A script is a series of instruction that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 

- Computers approach task in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically. 

- To approach writing a script , break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out eacg step needed to complete that task.
  - A flow chart can help.

# Expressions

Multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction. This can affect the number that you expect to see. 

To change the order in which operations are performed, place the calculation you want done first inside parentheses. 

# Functions

 A `Function` is a block of code design to perform a particular task. 

 It only executed when **"called"**

 Function parameters are listed inside parentheses `()`

 Arguments are values received by the function when it is invoked.
