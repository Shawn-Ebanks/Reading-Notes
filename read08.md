Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
Comparison and logical operators: 150-151, 156, and 157
for and while loops: 170 - 173, and 176

## Events Example "Mouse"

Markup that replaces the *before* picture with the *after* picture when the mouse goes over image shown below
 - `<img scr="before-pic.jpg" onMouseover="src='after-pic.jpg'">`

**onMouseover** is the keyword in camelCase then the equal sign `=` follow.

next is the *response* to the event in quotes `"`
  - Note the image source is enclosed in singles quotes as the event statement is closed in double quotes.

  ## Operators

  - === is strict equal to meaning checks value and type
  - ++ is increment 
  - -- is decrement


# Loops
Main loops JavaScript use are 
- **FOR** 
- **WHILE** 
- do..while
- for...in
- for...of

Loops check a condition and if logic is *true* a code block will run. Loop will keep running until logic is retunred false.

**FOR LOOPS** is used to run a statement a set number of times.

Unlike the **WHILE LOOP** will run nonstop until a certain condition is met.
