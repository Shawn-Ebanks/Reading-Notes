Markdown is a way to style text on the web, for example :

To make words appear bold on a web site you type ** front and back of the text. 
**Example 01** 

The Web browser will recognise the markdown and bolds the text and format any other markdown properties created.

Another example is _for italic text_

Adding ordered list is simple as well, just use "1." on each line. 
1. Example 1
1. Example 2
1. Example 3

Unordered list are similar; just add the * at the start of the text. 
* Example 1
* Example 2
* Example 3

Here is an example of a link "[](url)" see below for result.
