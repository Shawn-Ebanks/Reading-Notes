This is where I log my notes

Growth mindset to me is the ability to remain focus, learn from one's mistakes and never be too proud to ask for help. 
Also when you have acheieved your goal, the next step is **forward** find ways to improve, like efficiency.

Three reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset are:
1. "Failing to prepare,is same as preparing to fail" (A teacher in my 4th grade etched that into my brain)
2. Never give up, "If there's a will, there's a way" unknown source - Something I always heard.
3. "You don't know ,what you don't know"
