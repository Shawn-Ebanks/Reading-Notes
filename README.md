## Growth Mindset

_Explain “growth mindset” in your own words_

Growth mindset to me is the ability to remain focus, learn from one's mistakes and never be too proud to ask for help.
Also when you have acheieved your goal, the next step is **Forward** find ways to improve, like efficiency.

Three reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset are:

1. "Failing to prepare,is preparing to fail"
1. "Never give up", "If there's a will, there's a way"
1. "You don't know ,what you don't know"
